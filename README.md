# Credit Control & Debt Tracking System 📊

### 🏗️ Project Overview
This module is a core component of the **Albuksystems Retail Suite**. It is designed to solve the "silent killer" of small businesses: unmanaged credit. This system automates the tracking of customer debts, payment deadlines, and credit limits to ensure healthy cash flow.

### 🚀 Key Features (AI-Driven Logic)
- **Customer Debt Ledger:** Real-time tracking of individual balances.
- **Automated Aging Reports:** Categorizes debt by 30, 60, and 90+ days.
- **Credit Limit Enforcement:** System-level blocks on sales to high-risk accounts.
- **WhatsApp Integration Ready:** Designed to push automated payment reminders to clients.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Architecture:** Modular JavaScript/HTML for lightweight retail environments.
- **Data Structure:** JSON-based local storage for offline-first reliability in areas with unstable internet.
- **Development Method:** AI-assisted prototyping using Claude/GPT-4o for rapid iteration.

### 📂 How it Works
1. **Entry:** Sales data is captured and checked against the customer's credit profile.
2. **Analysis:** The system calculates the risk score based on payment history.
3. **Action:** Triggers a notification for overdue accounts to prevent stock leakage.
